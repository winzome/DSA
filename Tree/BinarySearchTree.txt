binary search tree , search time is O(h) where h is height


binary search tree has following properties
a => left subtree nodes < root
b => right subtree nodes > root
c => left & right subtree nodes are also bst with no duplicates  ( by default) , but sometimes bst can have duplicates

special property => inorder traversal are always sorted arrays 

skewed tree => unbalanced tree , entirely weighted in one side


----------------------------------------------------------------
delete a node 

3 case
1 delete a leaf
2 delete a node having 1 child
3 delete a node having 2 children


inorder successor = leftmost in right subtree

inorder successor has always 0 or 1 children
