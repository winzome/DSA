insert = O (1)
lookup = O (1)
delete = O (1)
search = O (1)

 Hashsets has all unique values , does not duplicate values

 sets does not maintain any order

 in java these hash functions gives O(1) - 
 put ()
 get ()
 containsKey ()
 remove()
 size ()
 keySet ()


 **** hashmap in java is internally implemented as array of linked lists ****

 data is saved in diffrent nodes of linked list at diffrent index of arrays ( buckets)

 hashing = change form of key and makes it unique value that is used as index (bucket) , at this bucket the data is saved

 one bucket can have multiple nodes / values / data saved in the form of linked list

 a threshhold (k) is declared above which size of the array is increased to add more elements

 lambda is (total no of nodes / size of the array) if lambda crosses the threshold size of array is increased 
 to make the Data structure more optimised

Rehashing -  Rehashing is the process of increasing the size of a hashmap and 
redistributing the elements to new buckets based on their new hash values
